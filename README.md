Data Structures and Algorithm solutions in JS and Python

## Want to contribute?

I always welcome any contributions, be they in the form of a new data structure/algorithm, editing a currently existing algorithm that does not work as expected, or improving the efficiency of one that exists. Please follow the existing organization. For more information on contributing an algorithm, please visit the [readme](https://github.com/bry-an/data-structures-algorithms/blob/master/javascript/algorithms/README.md) in JS Algs.  

Have fun!
