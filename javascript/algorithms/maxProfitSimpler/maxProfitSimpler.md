Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

e.g. given the array [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since that's the greatest profit that can be made.

Try doing this problem without using a nested for-loop, i.e. only iterating through the array once. (This is referred to as being done in O(n) time, whereas a nested for-loop would be O(n^2).)
