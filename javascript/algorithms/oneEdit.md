Given two strings, determine whether they are one edit from each other. An edit can be an insertion of one character, or a swapping of two characters.

The return value should be a string representing the type of operation and the character(s) involved.

For instance, "god" and "gold" should return "insert l"; "kelp" and "help" should return "swap k and h".
