# Boggle Search

Given a dictionary of words and a multi-dimensional array representing a Boggle board, determine which words in the dictionary are contained in the Boggle board.

Words can be constructed by moving to any adjacent letter in any direction (including backwards). Each letter can be used only once per word.

For example, given a dictionary ['cat', 'dog', "note"] and a board [['c', 'o', 'd'],
                      'a', 'g', 'n'],
                      'l', 't', 'e']]

you should return ['cat', 'dog']
