# Reduce to Create Object

With an input consisting of an array of numbers, return an object whose properties are the numbers contained in the array and values the frequency of each number in the array. Use JavaScript's `reduce()` method to create the object.  

Note: the order of items in the object is not important.

For example, given the array `[1, 5, 7, 5, 2, 2, 7, 12, 3, 5]` return `{ 1: 1, 5: 3, 7: 2, 2: 2, 12: 1, 3: 1}`.
