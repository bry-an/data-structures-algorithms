# JavaScript Algorithms

This is a collection of JavaScript algorithm challenges. The sources vary, however many of the problems are from [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/).  
The problems contained in folders have been recently reorganized, and include Node assertions that you can pull down and run for yourself. Feel free to add additional assertions to test the algorithms.

## Contribute

I welcome any contribution, whether it be in the form of a new question, editing an algorithm that does not function properly, or improving the efficiency of one of the included functions. Please indicate which type of contribution in your pull request. If you add a new question, please include it in the following form:  
QuestionName (folder)  
|  
....-> QuestionName.md (markdown explaining intended algorithm, preferably including example outputs)  
|  
....-> QuestionName.js (solution including assertions to test output against examples provided in markdown)

  If you would like to contribute a problem in another language, please do so in ../../ under a folder with the language you wish, following the same format as above.
